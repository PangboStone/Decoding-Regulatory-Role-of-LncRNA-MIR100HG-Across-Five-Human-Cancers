## 1. Executive Summary
This project presents a comprehensive computational biology workflow to investigate the regulatory landscape of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MIR100HG across five distinct cancer types: Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD), Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PAAD), Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD), Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM), and Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD). By integrating multi-omics data including gene expression (RNA-seq) and DNA methylation, the analysis explores two primary regulatory axes. Firstly, it examines the potential auto-regulation of MIR100HG through the methylation status of its own promoter region. Secondly, it delineates the downstream regulatory network by identifying key target genes and their interactions. To refine this network, a sophisticated ensemble model of Graph Attention Networks (GAT) is developed to predict and validate high-confidence regulatory relationships, moving beyond simple correlation to a more robust, machine learning-driven conclusion.

## 2. Problem Statement
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as critical regulators in various cellular processes, and their dysregulation is frequently implicated in cancer pathogenesis. MIR100HG, the host gene for the miR-100/let-7a-2/miR-125b-1 cluster, has been identified as a significant player in tumorigenesis, yet its precise regulatory mechanisms and functional network remain incompletely understood. This project aims to bridge this gap by systematically dissecting the regulatory functions of MIR100HG. The central objectives are:
- To investigate the relationship between MIR100HG's promoter DNA methylation and its own expression, exploring a potential epigenetic self-regulation loop.
- To identify and characterize the downstream regulatory sub-network controlled by MIR100HG.
- To construct a high-confidence MIR100HG-centric regulatory network by leveraging advanced graph neural network models to reduce noise and infer robust interactions.

## 5. Methodology
The project is executed through a sequential, three-stage analytical pipeline:

### Stage 1: Multi-Omics Data Preprocessing and Integration
This foundational stage focuses on filtering and fusing disparate data types into a cohesive, analysis-ready format.
1.  **Target Gene Identification:** The project begins by identifying all genes known to be regulated by MIR100HG from a global gene interaction database.
2.  **Expression Data Filtering:** The gene expression matrices for each cancer type are filtered to retain only MIR100HG and its identified target genes.
3.  **CpG Probe Mapping:** Genomic annotation files are used to locate the promoter region of MIR100HG. Subsequently, the DNA methylation probe map is scanned to identify all CpG probes located within this specific region.
4.  **Methylation Data Filtering:** The comprehensive methylation datasets are filtered to retain only the data from the MIR100HG-related CpG probes identified above.
5.  **Data Fusion:** The filtered expression data and filtered methylation data are integrated. The expression level of MIR100HG is appended as a new feature to the methylation matrix for each corresponding patient sample, creating the final unified dataset for downstream analysis.

### Stage 2: Correlation Analysis and Network Inference
This stage performs statistical analysis and initial network construction.
1.  **Methylation Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation analysis is conducted between the methylation levels of each CpG probe in the MIR100HG promoter and the expression level of MIR100HG itself. This tests the hypothesis of epigenetic auto-regulation. Results are visualised using heatmaps.
2.  **Downstream Network Construction:** A downstream regulatory network is built by first identifying MIR100HG target genes whose expression levels are significantly correlated with MIR100HG. Then, known interactions *between* these key targets are extracted from the interaction database and used to construct and visualise a preliminary regulatory graph with `NetworkX`.

### Stage 3: GNN-based Regulatory Network Refinement
To enhance the reliability of the inferred network, this stage employs a machine learning approach.
1.  **Feature Engineering:** A global interaction graph is constructed. Node features are engineered by combining gene expression profiles with structural graph embeddings generated using the `Node2Vec` algorithm.
2.  **Ensemble GNN Model:** An ensemble of Graph Attention Network (GAT) models is implemented. The GNNs are trained on subgraphs sampled from the global network to classify and score the likelihood of true regulatory links.
3.  **Network Prediction:** The trained ensemble model is used to predict the probability of a regulatory relationship between MIR100HG and other genes.
4.  **Final Network Construction:** A final, high-confidence regulatory network is constructed by retaining only those interactions that surpass a defined probability threshold, providing a robust model of the MIR100HG regulatory landscape.

## 6. Results & Visualisation
The key outputs of the scripts include:
- **Correlation Heatmaps:** Visualising the correlation between MIR100HG promoter methylation and gene expression across different cancer types.
- **Downstream Regulatory Network Graphs:** Network diagrams illustrating the regulatory connections between MIR100HG and its most significantly correlated target genes.
- **GNN-Predicted Network:** A refined, high-confidence network graph representing the most probable regulatory interactions involving MIR100HG.

Key Findings:
- **Context-Dependent Networks:** The co-expression networks associated with MIR100HG are highly dynamic and context-specific[cite: 104]. The set of correlated genes varies significantly depending on whether MIR100HG expression is high or low, and differs dramatically between cancer and corresponding normal tissues, suggesting significant network remodeling during tumorigenesis.
- **Prognostic Significance in STAD:** A key finding emerged from the survival analysis. High expression of MIR100HG was found to be a statistically significant predictor of poorer prognosis in Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD) patients across all three endpoints: OS (p=0.0003), DSS (p=0.0114), and PFI. This association was not significant in the other four cancer types, highlighting a cancer-specific prognostic role.
- **Important Regulatory Features:** Feature importance analysis from the MLP model identified several key transcription factors, including **FOXP2, PBX3, TCF12, and MAFK**, as being highly predictive of MIR100HG's expression status, reinforcing its integration into core gene regulatory networks.

## 8. Conclusion & Future Work
This project successfully establishes and executes a powerful multi-omics workflow to elucidate the complex regulatory role of the lncRNA MIR100HG in cancer. The findings provide insights into both its potential auto-regulatory mechanisms via promoter methylation and its broader influence on a network of target genes. The application of a GNN model marks a significant step towards building more accurate and reliable regulatory networks from complex biological data. 
This study also confirmed that MIR100HG's regulatory function is highly dependent on its cellular context, varying by expression level, cancer type, and tissue state (normal vs. malignant). While its general involvement with key regulators is clear, its specific interactions and clinical impact are tissue- and disease-specific. The discovery of its prognostic significance in STAD provides a strong foundation for further investigation.


**Future Directions:**
- **Clinical Integration:** Integrate clinical survival data to assess the prognostic significance of the identified MIR100HG network signature.
- **Experimental Validation:** The high-confidence interactions predicted by the GNN model serve as strong candidates for experimental validation in a wet lab setting.
- **Pan-Cancer Analysis:** Extend the analysis to a broader range of cancer types to identify both common and cancer-specific regulatory patterns of MIR100HG.
- **Integration of Methylation Data:** A primary next step is the full integration of the DNA methylation data to explore how MIR100HG expression correlates with epigenetic patterns, potentially revealing key mechanisms of gene regulation.
- **Advanced Network Inference:** Employ more complex network inference algorithms (e.g., mutual information-based methods) to capture non-linear relationships and infer directionality in the regulatory network.
